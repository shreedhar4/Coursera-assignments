      Breathe in the fresh air,<br>
Put your mind at ease.<br>
Let down your hair,<br>
Let it flow in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Let your eyes wander<br>
To all the beauty to be seen.<br>
If those toxic thoughts you still do ponder,<br>
Then let out a scream.<br>
<br>
Scream until the pain is gone,<br>
Until you no longer feel afraid.<br>
Open your eyes to a new dawn,<br>
Let the darkness fade.<br>
<br>
No longer compare yourself<br>
Or your flaws to others' perfections.<br>
Take the negativity off the shelf.<br>
Focus on your direction.<br>
<br>
Pick the sadness up off the floor,<br>
Sweep it into the wind.<br>
Close the door on self-hatred.<br>
Never let it back in.<br>

For the lies it would often tell you,<br>
You will no longer agree.<br>
Happiness and love are what you should hold onto.<br>
They are whom you should give the key.<br>
<br>
Pay no attention to the toxic thoughts,<br>
Listen to those who adore everything you are.<br>
Overthinking was what you once were taught,<br>
But now those thoughts you put in a jar.<br>
<br>
Focus on your goals,<br>
Never lose your fight.<br>
It's time to open new scrolls.<br>
Everything will be all right.<br>
<br>
